# Movie_Recommendation_System

A Recommender System employs a statistical algorithm that seeks to predict users ratings for a particular entity, 
based on the similarity between the entities or similarity between the users that previously rated those entities. 
The intuition is that similar types of users are likely to have similar ratings for a set of entities.

In this project, we'll develop a movie recommender system that uses the correlation between the ratings assigned to 
different movies, in order to find the similarity between the movies.

The dataset that we are going to use for this problem is the MovieLens Dataset. You will get the dataset in this 
link: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ contains a subset of the actual movie dataset and contains 100000 
ratings for 9000 movies by 700 users.
